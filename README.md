# Amazon Price Error Finder
This will run on Amazon AWS, quite bittersweet really, and will run on an EC2 instance along with a lambda function and SNS email notifications when it finds something.

As I am currently in the market for some new golf clubs this will scrape Amazon's pages with the keyword of golf and then will have a list of brand names that will be used to cross check wether to scrape the info eg. Callaway, Taylormade, Titleist.
